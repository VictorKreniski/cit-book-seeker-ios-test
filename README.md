# Architecture

I've used MVVM to create the structure of the App, but wen't sligthy different on the View Model. Tried a concept that I've be using in jobs that I've had, that is a Model View Controller to substitute the Model View Concept. It only adds more complexity to the object, giving a responsability to maintain and distribute value type instances throughout the code. 

# UI Prototype

I've choosen [Framer](https://www.framer.com/) to prototype the App.

# Difficulties 

Never used SwiftLint before, and for some reason, I would not be able to compile the binary, after installing the CocoaPods. After some hours spent trying to understand what was happening I could make it functional. 

# Scrum

I've created a kamban to maintaing reference that was needed to be done, what was being done and what was completed. It helped me maintaing control on the development flow that I had to have in order to deliver what was expected in three days.
