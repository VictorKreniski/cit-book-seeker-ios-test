# iTunes Book Seeker - Challenge proposed by CI&T
This project was builded withing 3 days and its objective consists in showing my knowledge at the iOS App development.
The app consist in searching iTunes eBooks and being able to check more details, saving the last 10 words that were used to search.

# Architecture

I've used MVVM to create the structure of the App, but wen't sligthy different on the View Model. Tried a concept that I've be using in jobs that I've had, that is a Model View Controller to substitute the Model View Concept. It only adds more complexity to the object, giving a responsability to maintain and distribute value type instances throughout the code. 

# UI Prototype

I've choosen [Framer](https://www.framer.com/) to prototype the App. 

# Difficulties 

Never used SwiftLint before, and for some reason, I would not be able to compile the binary, after installing the CocoaPods. After some hours spent trying to understand what was happening I could make it functional. 

# Scrum

I've created a kamban to maintaing reference that was needed to be done, what was being done and what was completed. It helped me maintaing control on the development flow that I had to have in order to deliver what was expected in three days.
