By Lemuel Gulliver, First a Surgeon, and then a Captain of Several Ships, better known simply as Gulliver's Travels (1726, amended 1735), is a novel by Irish writer and clergyman Jonathan Swift, that is both a satire on human nature and a parody of the \"travellers' tales\" literary sub-genre. It is Swift's best known full-length work, and a classic of English literature. The book became popular as soon as it was published. John Gay wrote in a 1726 letter to Swift that \"It is universally read, from the cabinet council to the nursery.\" [1] Since then, it has never been out of print. Cavehill in Belfast is thought to be the inspiration for the novel. Swift imagined that the mountain resembled the shape of a sleeping giant safeguarding the city. [2]",

Using the techniques needed on the race track, one can successfully navigate all of life's ordeals.<br /><br />On the eve of his death, Enzo takes stock of his life, recalling all that he and his family have been through: the sacrifices Denny has made to succeed professionally; the unexpected loss of Eve, Denny's wife; the three-year battle over their daughter, Zoë, whose maternal grandparents pulled every string to gain custody. In the end, despite what he sees as his own limitations, Enzo comes through heroically to preserve the Swift family, holding in his heart the dream that Denny will become a racing champion with Zoë at his side. Having learned what it takes to be a compassionate and successful person, the wise canine can barely wait until his next lifetime, when he is sure he will return as a man. <br /><br />A heart-wrenching but deeply funny and ultimately uplifting story of family, love, loyalty, and hope, The Art of Racing in the Rain is a beautifully crafted and captivating look at the wonders and absurdities of human life . . . as only a dog could tell it.",

Students will be able to create iOS apps that adhere to standard practices, including use of stock UI elements and layout techniques, and common navigation interfaces. They’ll continue to their app design journey by brainstorming, planning, prototyping, and evaluating an app of their own. Guided App Projects help students build an app in Xcode with step-by-step instructions while allowing students try out parts of code with without having to build an entire app from the beginning to accelerate their coding Swift skills. Xcode Playgrounds helps students learn key programming concepts as they write Swift code in playgrounds—an interactive coding environment that lets them experiment with code and see the results immediately.",

It is Swift's best known full-length work, and a classic of English literature. The book became popular as soon as it was published. John Gay wrote in a 1726 letter to Swift that \"It is universally read, from the cabinet council to the nursery.\"[1] Since then, it has never been out of print.",

A nice easy Simple Guide to show the path Taylor took to success. The early days singing at a Philly's game to singing to over 100,000 people at the Gillette Stadium. Moving closer to Nashville to make the regular trips easier for this budding new artist. Understanding where Taylor gets her ideas for her songs from will help you understand the meaning behind them. Like most young women, Taylor has friends, favorite things to do and has had a few boyfriends that she does write about, if she feels strongly about it. The truth about a person is shown by what they do, not by something written by someone else or something they say. Taylor donates to causes close to her heart and has a strong bond with her fans, it's thanks to them she can be so generous. Read the book, enjoy her story and go and create yours.",

Jefferson Parker, Roland Ford is hunting down a mysterious killer, jockeying for position with the FBI, and risking everything to save a friend in terrible jeopardy.<\/b><br /><br />Returning hero and private investigator Roland Ford is on the trail of a mysterious killer who is beheading CIA drone operators and leaving puzzling clues at each crime scene. His troubled friend Lindsay Rakes is afraid for her own life and the life of her son after a fellow flight crew member is killed in brutal fashion. Even more terrifying is the odd note the killer left behind: \"Welcome to Caliphornia. This is not the last.\" Ford strikes an uneasy alliance with San Diego-based FBI agent Joan Taucher, who is tough as nails but haunted by what she sees as the Bureau's failure to catch the 9/11 terrorists, many of whom spent their last days in her city. As the killer strikes again, Ford and Taucher dash into the fray, each desperate for their own reasons--each ready to risk it all to stop the killer from doing far more damage.",

As sixteen-year-old Jonathan Swift carefully slides through dry brush in the dark, he hopes to bag some game to help feed his family. As a branch cracks nearby, Jonathan suddenly realizes he is not alone. Moments later, he manages to shed his pursuer and arrives home, shaken. His escape is temporary, however, and events will soon take a turn that changes the direction of Jonathan's life forever.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tFrustrated when they cannot catch him in the act of poaching, the squire's men ambush Jonathan and leave him for dead on a Royal Navy ship. Although he has never been on a ship before, Swift finds he is a new member of HMS Winchester's company. Unaccustomed to disciplined shipboard life and without friends, family, or security, he soon realizes that he must persevere or die.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tIn this historical tale, a young man pressed into the navy discovers that his destiny is more dangerous than he ever imagined when he finds himself in the midst of an attack on the most formidable fort in North America.",
